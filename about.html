	<h3><u>Arabica </u><br></h3>
Coffea Arabica originated from the original coffee trees discovered in Ethiopia.  Around 70% of the world's coffee is produced by these trees, which also result in a fine, mild, aromatic coffee. In comparison to Robusta, the beans are thinner longer, and less caffeinated.<br><br>

Arabica coffees fetch the greatest prices on the global marketplace. Arabica trees are expensive to grow since their ideal spot is often steep and difficult to access. Additionally, the trees need more care and consideration because they are vulnerable to disease than Robusta.<br><br>

	<h3><u>Robusta </u><br></h3>
Robusta coffee, which is frequently grown in Africa, Vietnam, and Indonesia, has lower levels of acidity than Arabica coffee, which means it usually tastes much less sweet. Due to its simpler acidity and more profound and stronger flavour components, Robusta can produce tones of wood or burnt rubber. Due to the thick layer of crema and rich flavor it produces, it is a popular choice for espressos.<br><br>

Robustas are often more affordable than Arabicas because they are less prone to pests and environmental conditions. The greater caffeine concentration of Robusta coffee beans is another factor to keep in mind.<br><br>

	<h3><u>Liberica  </u><br></h3>
The Liberica bean is one of the most difficult to come across various kinds of coffee bean. They are bigger than the other beans and are known to be the only ones in the world with an unusual shape.<br><br>

Liberica beans have a distinctive scent of their own; some people describe it as delicious and aromatic in addition to being smoky. <br><br>

	<h3><u>Excelsa  </u><br></h3>
It is commonly used in blends to give the coffee an extra burst of taste and complexity, better effecting the middle and the tastebuds. Excelsa is claimed to feature a sweet and fruity body—flavors representation of a light roast—that also has dark, roasty layer.<br><br>
