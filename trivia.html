	<b><h2><h2>Did you Know?</b><br></h2>
		<u>Coffee beans are seeds.</u><br>
			We refer to them as "beans" due to their similarity to beans, but they are actually the pits of the cherry-like berries that can be found on blooming shrubs.<br><br>

<u>Coffee cherries are edible.</u><br>
Previously, according to PBS, people combined fat and coffee berries to make an energizing snack ball. The pulp would also be fermented to create an alcoholic product similar to wine.<br><br>

<u>Italian for "pressed out" is espresso.</u><br>
In order to create espresso, boiling water is forced through pressed coffee grounds. Additionally, because espresso contains more caffeine per volume than coffee, three shots are needed to equal the amount in a typical cup of joe.<br><br>

<u>The biggest coffee fans are found in Finland.</u><br>
The International Coffee Organization estimates that an adult Finn consumes 27.5 pounds of coffee annually. That is in contrast to the low eleven ounces per American.<br><br>

<u>Coffee consumers have a higher life expectancy.</u><br>
According to Harvard Health Publishing, studies have linked moderate intake (about three to four cups per day) with a higher life expectancy as well as a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and Parkinson's.<br><br>


<u>Caffeine-free does not equate to decaf.</u><br>
According to the Mayo Clinic, an eight-ounce brewed cup of decaf coffee actually contains two to 12 milligrams of caffeine. A typical cup of coffee contains between 95 and 200 milligrams of caffeine, while a can of cola contains between 23 and 35 mg.<br><br>

<u>The Arabic term for wine is where the word "coffee" originates.</u><br>
Later, qahwah became kahveh in Turkish and koffie in Dutch, from which the English word coffee was derived.<br><br>

<u>Your skin can benefit from coffee grounds.</u><br>
"Coffee grounds are physical exfoliators that can lift off dead skin cells, making skin feel smooth and look brighter," claims chemist Danusia Wnek of the Good Housekeeping Beauty Lab. And although there isn't enough clinical evidence to support the use of caffeine in topical treatments, it is believed to enhance skin blood flow.<br><br>

<u>Coffee wasn't always meant to be sipped.</u><br>
Coffee used to be a meal until people realized it made a good beverage. The berries were ground up and combined with animal fat by the tribes of East Africa before being consumed.<br>



	<h2><b><p>Benefits</b><br></h2>
<u>Supports heart health </u><br>
According to several studies, drinking coffee may be good for your heart and that three to five cups of coffee a day were associated with a 15% lower risk of heart disease.<br><br>

	<u>It could increase longevity </u><br>
It was said that it could lengthen lifespan.<br><br>
According to some research, coffee's numerous potential health advantages may help shorten lifespan. It's interesting to note that a test-tube study found that coffee greatly increased the lifespan of yeast by guarding against free radicals and DNA damage. <br><br>

	<u>Enhance athletic performance </u><br>
Possibly boost athletic performance.<br><br>

Coffee is frequently used by athletes as a stimulating supplement to boost energy and performance. According to a study of nine research, compared to a control group, consuming coffee before exercise increased people's endurance and decreased their feeling of fatigue. <Br><br>

	<u>Protect against liver conditions </u><br>
Numerous studies indicate that coffee may promote liver health and offer disease protection.<br><br>
Another recent study discovered that drinking coffee was known to have lessened liver stiffness, which is a measurement used by medical practitioners to evaluate fibrosis, the development of scar tissue in the liver.<br><br>

	<u>Linked to a lower risk of depression </u><br>
According to some research, drinking coffee may reduce your risk of developing depression.
Each daily cup of coffee was associated with an 8% decreased rate of depression, according to a study of seven research.<br><br>

	<u>May promote weight management </u><br>
Higher levels of physical activity are helpful in weight control. Coffee may modify fat storage and support gut health, both of which may be beneficial for weight management.<br><br>
