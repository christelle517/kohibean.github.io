		<section id="head">
		<center><h3><b>BLACK</h3></b></center>
		<p> Known also as Cafe Noir. With ground coffee beans dissolved in hot water and served warm, black coffee is as straightforward as it goes. </p>

		<h3><b>LATTE</h3></b>
		<p> A shot of espresso, heated milk, and a tiny bit of froth make up a latte.  </p>

		<h3><b>CAPPUCCINO</h3></b>
		<p> A cappuccino is a latte that has more foam than steamed milk and is occasionally topped with cocoa powder or cinnamon. There are occasionally alternatives available that use flavor shots or cream in place of milk. </p>

		<h3><b>AMERICANO</h3></b>
		<p> The americano, which is made up of an espresso shot diluted in hot water, has a flavor similar to black coffee. A helpful hint: pour the espresso first, then add the hot water.  </p>

		<h3><b>ESPRESSO</h3></b>
		<p> A single espresso shot can be consumed as served or used as the base for the majority of coffee beverages, including lattes and macchiatos. </p>

		<h3><b>DOPPIO</h3></b>
		<p> The doppio, a double dose of espresso. </p>

		<h3><b>CORTADO</h3></b>
		<p> The pairing of espresso and warm, steamed milk in a cortado is superb. The milk is used to reduce the bitterness of the espresso. </p>

		<h3><b>RED EYE</h3></b>
		<p> An espresso shot infused into a hot cup of coffee. </p>
	
		<h3><b>GALAO</h3></b>
		<p> This hot coffee beverage, which has Portuguese roots, is similar to the lattes and cappuccinos. The only distinction is that it has nearly twice as much foamed milk as the other two drinks, making it lighter. </p>

		<h3><b>LUNGO</h3></b>
		<p> Lungo is an espresso with a long pull. The amount of caffeine and the volume of ounces you are able to consume increase with the length of the pull. </p>

		<h3><b>MACCHIATO</h3></b>
		<p> Another espresso-based beverage with a thin layer of foam on top is the macchiato. This drink creates a balance between a cappuccino and a doppio. </p>

		<h3><b>MOCHA</h3></b>
		<p> The mocha is an espresso-based chocolate beverage with steamed milk and foam. </p>

		<h3><b>RISTRETTO</h3></b>
		<p> An espresso shot is a ristretto. In contrast to the bitter taste of a typical shot of espresso or a doppio, it makes use of less hot water, giving the beverage a sweeter flavor. </p>

		<h3><b>FLAT WHITE</h3></b>
		<p> This Australian-made beverage resembles a cappuccino without the foam or chocolate topping. The beverage is an espresso with steamed milk. </p>
	
		<h3><b>AFFOGATO</h3></b>
		<p> Served with a shot or two of espresso and a scoop of ice cream. </p>
	
		<h3><b>CAFE AU LAIT</h3></b>
		<p> For the coffee enthusiast who wants a little more flavor, café au lait is ideal. Just a little warm milk to a cup of coffee will do the trick. </p>

		<h3><b>IRISH</h3></b>
		<p> Irish coffee is prepared with black coffee, whiskey, sugar, and whipped cream on top. </p>

		<h2><b>Types of Cold Coffee Drinks</b><br></h2>
		</section>

		<section id="head">
		<h3><b>ICED COFFEE</h3></b>
		<p> Iced coffee is as simple as a coffee with ice, often served with a dash of milk, cream, or sugar.  </p>

		<h3><b>ICED ESPRESSO</h3></b>
		<p> It can serve iced espresso either plain or with a dash of milk, cream, or sugar. </p>

		<h3><b>COLD BREW</h3></b>
		<p> Just add cold milk or cream when the beans are done steeping. </p>

		<h3><b>FRAPPUCCINO</h3></b>
		<p> A blended iced coffee beverage known as a frappuccino is topped with whipped cream and syrup.  </p>

		<h3><b>NITRO</h3></b>
		<p> Bubbles of nitrogen added to a cold brew create a frothy, Guinness-like cold brew coffee. </p>

		<h3><b>MASAGRAN</h3></b>
		<p> Iced coffee, tea, and your favorite rum beverage are all combined to create mazagran coffee. It usually contains espresso, lemon, sugar, and occasionally rum. </p>
